### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm a self-taught developer who's been working on web apps and Discord bots for over **3 years**.

I started out by creating tools for friends, then slowly moved into building real systems — some of which are now used by international Discord communities (yes, even in Thailand 🇹🇭).

I'm especially passionate about:
- Making interfaces that are clean and functional.
- Writing code that's easy to scale and understand.
- Mixing creativity with logic (bots with AI... yes please 🤖✨).

Some of my projects are public, others are private or custom-made for clients.  
But I always enjoy building things that are **actually useful**.

---

### 🛠 Tech I'm Confident With

- `JavaScript / TypeScript`
- `Node.js / Next.js`
- `HTML / CSS`
- `Discord.js` (v13, v14)
- `React` (basics)
- `Python` (still learning 🐍)

I mostly work with full-stack JavaScript tools, but I'm always open to trying new things.

### 🔍 Current Focus

- Sharpening my frontend design skills (Tailwind, UI/UX)
- Learning more about backend performance & security
- Exploring simple AI integrations for bots & dashboards
